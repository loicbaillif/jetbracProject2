		 * shapes of their rooms. The rooms can be triangular, 
		 * rectangular, and round. 
		 * 
		 * Write a program that calculates the floor area of the rooms. 
		 * 
		 * Input data format: The type of the room shape and the 
		 * relevant parameters. 
		 * 
		 * Output data format: The area of the resulting room. 
		 * 
		 * Note that the value of 3.14 is used instead of the number 
		 * (pi) in Malevia.
