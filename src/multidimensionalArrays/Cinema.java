		/* ****** EXERCISE : Cinema ******
		 * The cinema has n rows, each row consists of m seats (n and m do 
		 * not exceed 20). A two-dimensional matrix stores the information 
		 * on the sold tickets: the number 1 means that the ticket for this 
		 * place is already sold, and the number 0 means that the place is 
		 * available. You want to buy k tickets to neighboring seats in the 
		 * same row. Find whether it can be done. 
		 * 
		 * --> Input data format 
		 * 		On the input, the program gets the number of n rows and m 
		 *  	seats. Then, there are n lines, each containing m numbers 
		 *  	(0 or 1) separated by spaces. The last line contains the 
		 *  	number k.
		 *  
		 *  --> Output data format
		 *  	The program should output the number of the row with k 
		 *  	consecutive available seats. If there are several rows with k 
		 *  	available seats, output the first row with these seats. If 
		 *  	there is no such a row, output the number 0.
