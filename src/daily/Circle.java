/* ****** DAILY PROBLEM: Area of a circle ******
 * 
 * The Circle class represents a circle. Implement the Measurable interface 
 * and add a single method area that returns the area of a circle.
 * 
 * Note: Java has a built-in constant for PI: Math.PI
 * 
 * The class will be tested by creating an instance 
 * of Circle and invoking its area method
 */

    	return this.radius * this.radius * Math.PI;
