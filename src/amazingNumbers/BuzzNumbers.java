/* ****** PROJECT AMAZING NUMBERS : Stage 1/8 - Buzz Numbers ****** 
 * 
 * 
 * Description
 * Integers can be even or odd. All numbers that end with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are 
 * even; the rest are odd. However, numbers have many other properties, you 
 * will learn about some of them in this project.
 * 
 * First, let's talk about Buzz numbers. They are numbers that are either 
 * divisible by 7 or end with 7. For example, the number 14 is a buzz number, 
 * since it is divisible by 7 without a remainder; the number 17 ends with 7, 
 * so it is also a buzz number. However, the number 75 is not a Buzz number, 
 * since it is neither divisible by 7 nor does it end with 7. 
 * The number 7 is a Buzz number too.
 * 
 * Your task at this stage is to write a program that prints the natural 
 * number parity and determines whether this number is a Buzz. The program 
 * should print why this number is a Buzz number.
 * 
 * Do you know how to determine whether a number is divisible by 7 or not? 
 * We have a great tip:
 * 
 * - Remove the last digit;
 * - Multiply the removed digit by 2 and subtract it from the remaining number.
 * - If the result of the subtraction can be divided by 7, then the initial 
 * 	 number is divisible by 7. You can apply the whole sequence multiple times 
 *   until you get a relatively small/easy-to-interpret subtraction result.
 *   
 * For example, take 196. We remove the last digit and get 19. We subtract 12 
 * (the removed digit multiplied by 2) to get 7. Since the last left digit 
 * is 7, the number is multiple of 7. So 196 is a Buzz number!
 * 
 * You can use any solution you want, the tests won't check it.
 * 
 * 
 * Objectives
 * Your program should check whether the given natural number is a buzz number.
 * 
 * 1) Ask a user to enter a natural number.
 * 2) If the number is not natural, print an error message.
 * 3) Calculate and print the parity of the number.
 * 4) Check whether is the number is a Buzz number and print the explanation. 
 * 5) Finish the program after printing the message. 
 * 
 * Natural numbers are whole numbers starting from 1.
