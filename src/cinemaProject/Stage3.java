		/* ****** PROJECT : Cinema Room Manager - Stage 3 ******
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Description
		 * When choosing a ticket you are guided not only by your space 
		 * preference but also by your finances. Let's implement the 
		 * opportunity to check the ticket price and see the reserved seat.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Objectives
		 * Read two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows 
		 * and seats in each row and print the seating arrangement like in the 
		 * first stage. Then, read two integer numbers from the input: 
		 * a row number and a seat number in that row. These numbers represent 
		 * the coordinates of the seat according to which the program should 
		 * print the ticket price. The ticket price is determined by the same 
		 * rules as the previous stage:
		 * 
		 * 	- If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 
		 * 	  60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
		 *  - In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half 
		 *    of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that 
		 *    the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case,
		 *    the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the 
		 *    last 5 rows.
		 *    
		 * After that, the program should print out all the seats in the 
		 * screen room as shown in the example and mark the chosen seat by 
		 * the B symbol. Finally, it should print the ticket price and stop. 
		 * Note that in this project, the number of rows and seats won't be 
		 * greater than 9.
